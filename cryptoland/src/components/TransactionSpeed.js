              Boasting one of the fastest transaction speeds in the
              Cryptocurrency Industry, outpacing even the most tenured coins,
              CRYPTO provides its holders with immediate fund transfers,
              providing both merchant and consumer stability, predictability and
              accuracy with every transaction. In an always-changing market,
              crypto-value can change rapidly over a span of just minutes,
              leaving room for imprecision during standard transfers, payments
              and transactions. CRYPTO eliminates this potential downfall
              through the utilization of the Stellar (XLM) blockchain. Designed
              for the world's most prominent financial institutions, this
              blockchain is poised to manage billions of transactions
              simultaneously without the negative effects of overloading that
              can cause delays in other mass-use cryptocurrencies. In providing
              our community members the fastest transaction speeds available to
              the industry, we ensure accuracy and timeliness in every instance
              our coin is being used.{' '}
