      <p>After graduating from Oklahoma State University, with a degree in business finance, after 3 years, I entered the professional world and began my career as a financial analyst for one of the top financial institutions in the United States. After succeeding in this role for some time, my entrepreneurial drive led me to leave the traditional corporate space in order to focus on and leverage my innate leadership qualities and my passion for team building.</p>

      <p>In the infancy of my entrepreneurial endeavors, Bitcoin was presented to me as a potential portfolio investment. I understood the revolutionary impact this would have on international payment platforms and commerce. In less than one year, I leveraged a low 5-figure investment in Bitcoin into an 8-figure return, allowing me to immerse myself in the world of cryptocurrency, and begin my path in becoming an expert on market trends, volatility, ICO structure, market theory, and alternative coins such as Ethereum and XRP Ripple.</p>

      <p>My interest in financial growth and independence, coupled with my drive to teach and connect with others led me to solidify myself within the crypto space while simultaneously working as an independent affiliate, building organizations containing 3.2 million members within 23 countries. This led to the creation my global hedge fund operated out of Hong Kong, China.</p>

      <p>As a consultative adviser, I have helped more than 20,000 students make consistent, educated trades that have yielded consistent returns on their investments. I began my Crypto Coach course to disseminate my knowledge to all those seeking to become an expert within the crypto space, and solidified my peer appointed moniker “Crypto Corey” in a formal educational setting.</p>
